/*
 * This implementation uses a static inner helper class to hold the singleton
 * instance. The inner class is not loaded into memory until it's referenced
 * for the first time in the getInstance() method.
 * It is thread-safe without requiring explicit synchronization.
 *
 * When the getInstance() method is called for the first time, it triggers the
 * loading of the SingletonHelper class.
 * When the inner class is loaded, it creates the INSTANCE of BillPughSingleton.
 * The final keyword ensures that the INSTANCE cannot be reassigned.
 * The Bill Pugh Singleton implementation, while more complex than Eager
 * Initialization provides a perfect balance of lazy initialization, thread
 * safety, and performance, without the complexities of some other patterns
 * like double-checked locking.
